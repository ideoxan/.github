### 🤗 Welcome!
Welcome to the Ideoxan open source project. Open source software is the ❤️ and 🧠 of
Ideoxan. This GitHub organization is where all of our code calls home. We've been working on
Ideoxan since the beginning of 2020 and we're very excited to share our work with the world. So
far, **over 400 pull requests** have been merged, **1,400 commits** have been authored, and
**over a dozen contributors** have assisted with the project. We're always looking for new
contributors who are just as passionate as we are.

### 👩‍💻 Who are we?
We are a community of passionate developers who are dedicated to building the best learning
platform for everyone.

Ideoxan is committed to a future where everyone can learn programming with ease. It is essential
for tomorrow's workforce to be armed with the tools of today. Through free and educational
